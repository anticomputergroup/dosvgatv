From the original author:
  - The use for this code, current and later developments based on this, should NOT go commercial. This has been free since the beggining, and will be into the future. No profit should be made on this.

  - The name(s) of the author(s) that contributed to the development of the driver, will always appear on the code and/or documentation, and that includes me :-)
